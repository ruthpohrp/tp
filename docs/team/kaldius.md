### Project: DukePro(f)

DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists university professors in managing their consultations.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about XX Loc.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added Blocked Slot feature.
    * What it does: blocks out a time slot so that an Event cannot be added at that time slot.
    * Justification: Users are likely to want to block out certain time slots for personal reasons. This feature allows them to do so and not have to worry about accidentally adding an Event that coincides with a blocked period.
