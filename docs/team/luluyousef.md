### Project: DukePro(f)

DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists university professors in managing their
consultations.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 42k Loc.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Upcoming Events feature([#70](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/70))
    * What it does: Lists down all the upcoming consultation events for the day.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to quickly find the upcoming events for the day so that they: 
        * know how many consults they have to do until they're free.
        * Are ready and prepare for the upcoming consultations beforehand
        
* **New Feature**: Next Event feature([#70](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/70))
    * What it does: Lists down all the upcoming consultation events for the day.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to find the next consultation event for the day so that they are prepared and informed about all the relevant details of the consultation event coming up.

* **New Feature**: Filter By Tag feature([#91](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/91))
    * What it does: Finds all consultation events whose tag(s) match the paramater(s) inputted by the user.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to quickly look up the consultation events that have specific tag(s). 
                     It is relevant because the user might want to find events such as those that are urgent and prepare for them beforehand.
