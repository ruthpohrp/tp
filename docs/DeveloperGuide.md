### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of DukePro(f).

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

| Component | Description | API | Concrete Implementation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**`Main`**|Consists of two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them with each other upon app launch. Upon shut down, it also responsible for shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.|-|-|

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />


The `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (in order to prevent outside components' from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

`Logic` is split into 2 packages, `Command` and `Parser`. This is how `Logic` works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ScheduleParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions discussed above for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the earlier class diagram) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
1. When called upon to parse a user command, the `ScheduleParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ScheduleParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
2. All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the schedule data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `SortEventList` object) and all `BlockedSlot` objects (which are contained in a `SortedBlockedSlotList`).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Schedule`, which `Event` references. This allows `Schedule` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can _save_ both **schedule data** and **user preference data** in json format, and _read_ them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ScheduleStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### SortedEventList - Galvin

#### Description
The `SortedEventList` class provides an abstraction over an internal list of `Events`.
The `SortedEventList` supports minimal list operations including add, remove and set.
Duplicate Events are allowed in this Event list to accommodate repeated consultations with the same person.

#### Implementation
The `SortedEventList` class contains 2 fields, `internalList` and `internalUnmodifiableList`.

The `internalList` is an `ObservableArrayList` that is not sorted.

The `internalUnmodifiableList` is a `SortedList` that wraps around the `internalList` to maintain the sorted property of Events.
All changes in the `internalList` are propagated immediately to the SortedList.
An `EventComparator` class that implements the `Comparator` interface is created and used when constructing `SortedList`.

The `SortedEventList#asUnmodifiableObservableList()` method returns an ObservableList that the Ui can listen to display the list of consultations on the right.
This ObservableList will have its Events sorted chronologically.
This ObservableList is unmodifiable as part of defensive programming to prevent other classes from adding or deleting events from the ObservableList.

### List Free Slots Command - Galvin

#### Description
The `ListFreeSlotsCommand` class is a command that lists all the free slots in the schedule starting from 0000 of today to 2359 of day with the last event/blocked slot.

#### Implementation
The `ListFreeSlotsCommand` class has one field `today` of type `Date`. This field is necessary to allow testing, where a specific date can be passed in to the `ListFreeSlotsCommand`.

![](images/ListFreeSlotsCommand.png)

The `execute()` method calls `model#getFreeSlots()` which calls `schedule#getFreeSlots()`.

![](images/getFreeSlotsActivityDiagram.png)

The `schedule#getFreeSlots()` method first combines the `SortedEventList` and the `SortedBlockedSlotList` into one list of Overlappables.

The `schedule#getFreeSlots()` method then iterates through this list of Overlappables to find free slots between events and blocked slots. 

#### Design Considerations:

|   |Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
| Alternative 1: Implement FreeSlots as a special Event and store FreeSlots in the SortedEventList|Easy to list all free slots in the schedule by using a predicate to select only FreeSlots and updating the filteredList.|Adding, deleting and editing event will be harder as the corresponding FreeSlot at that timeslot will need to be deleted or edited. Only one list containing all Events, FreeSlots and BlockedSlots is allowed.|
| Alternative 2 (current): Go through the schedule each time the user uses the `list_free` command to find free slots|Easy to add and delete and edit events in SortedEventList. Easy to add additional lists such as SortedBlockedSlotList.|More computationally intensive as each time the user uses the `list_free` command, DukePro(f) will iterate through all events and blocked slots to find free slots in between.|

Alternative 2 is chosen to allow future implementations such as adding additional lists 
containing different types of events or commitments. 

### UpcomingEventsCommand - Lulu
#### Description
The `UpcomingEventCommand` class is a command that lists all the upcoming events scheduled for the current day excluding
the ongoing consultation event.

#### Implementation
The `UpcomingEventsCommand` class has one field timePredicate of type EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate.

`EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's timeslot and date is after the current time and date.

The `UpcomingEventsCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered list of the upcoming events, filtered by the `timePredicate`.

### NextEventCommand - Lulu
#### Description
The `NextEventCommand` class is a command that displays the next event based on the current time in the schedule.

#### Implementation
The `NextEventCommand` class has one field timePredicate of type EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate.

`EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's timeslot and date is after the current time and date.

The `NextEventCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered upcoming event that is filtered by the `timePredicate`.
Next, it gets the first event in the filtered list using the overridden method `nextEventInTheList()` found in the `ModelManager` class.

### FilterByTag Command - Lulu
#### Description
The `FilterByTagCommand` class is a command that finds all the consultation events whose tags contain any of the specified keywords (case-insensitive) and displays them as an indexed list.

#### Implementation
The `FilterByTagCommand` class has one field tagPredicate of type TagContainsKeywordsPredicate.

`TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's tag(s) matches any of the keyword(s) given.

The `FilterByTagCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered list of the events that have the specified tag. It is filtered by the `tagPredicate`.

### Remark feature - Ruth

#### Description

The remark feature is an optional description added to `Event`. It adds a remark to the
consultation event, and is stored internally as a `Remark` in `seedu.address.model.event.Event`.

#### Implementation

The `Remark` class has one field `value` of type String.

Unlike the other Objects in `Event`, all `Remark` inputs are valid, and hence do not need to check for Validity, unless the input is `null`.

There are two ways the remark can be added to an `Event`:
* `AddCommand(Event)` method  — Adds a new `Event` to the list (now with an optional remark description attached to it).
* `EditCommand(Event)` method — Edits the remark description of an existing `Event` on the list.

As a Remark is an optional input, if user does not input any remarks when adding a new event, the Remark will simply be stored as an empty String `””` in `Remark` in `Event` as default.

To display the remark in the GUI, a new `Label` called `remark` is added to `EventCard` as well as `EventListCard.fxml`.

### CommandSummaryCommand - Jacob
#### Description

The `CommandSummaryCommand` class is a command that opens a pop-up window containing a Command Summary of DukePro(f)'s
possible commands.

#### Implementation

This implementation of this command adds another parameter `showCommands` (which has a default value of `false`) to the 
constructor of `CommandResult`.

When the command `command_summary` is input by the user, `LogicManager` parses the input and returns a 
`CommandSummaryCommand`. The `execute` method is called with the `showCommands` parameter being set to `true`. 
This causes `MainWindow` to execute the `handleCommandSummary` method, which opens the Command Summary Page.

### Block Feature
#### Description

The Block feature allows the user to block off a specified period of time so that it is not possible for a new `Event` to be created during that time slot.

#### Implementation

##### Model
The following class diagram illustrates the implementation of the Block feature.

<img src="images/BlockedSlotClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

As shown in the class diagram, both `Event` and `BlockedSlot` implement the `Overlappable` interface. They also have their respective implementations of the `SortedOverlappableList` interface, `SortedEventList` and `SortedBlockedSlotList` respectively.
Every `Overlappable` is able to check if it overlaps with another `Overlappable`. This allows us to maintain a `SortedEventList` and a `SortedBlockedSlotList` in a `Schedule` and check against both lists when adding/editing an `Overlappable`.

##### Logic
The Block feature comes with the following new commands, they are quite self-explanatory:
1. `AddBlockedSlotCommand`
2. `ListBlockedSlotsCommand`
3. `DeleteBlockedSlotCommand`

Existing commands `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` also had to be edited(see below) to check for overlaps before adding/editing the `Event`.

The following steps describe the execution of an `AddCommand`(`EditCommand`follows similarly):
1. The `execute()` method of the `AddCommand` checks if the `Event` to be added overlaps with any items in the `Schedule`'s `SortedEventList` or `SortedBlockedSlotList`.
   1. If there is an overlap, a `SlotBlockedException`(which extends `CommandException`) is thrown, with an error message telling the user if the command was blocked by another event or a blocked slot.
   2. If there is no overlap, the new `Event` is added and the command succeeds.

##### Storage
These changes also made the new `JsonAdaptedBlockedSlot` necessary in order to save blocked slots created by the user into the save file.

Design Considerations

|   |Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Alternative 1: Have the `TimeSlot` class maintain a list of blocked time slots and prevent any new overlapping `TimeSlots` from being created.|Easy to implement. User is able to block out a specific time slot every day(e.g., 1800-1900 for dinner every day)|Does not work well with `FreeSlots` feature. User is unable to choose which days to have the blocked slot as it is applied to every day.|
|Alternative 2 (currently chosen): Implementation described above.|Code is easier to extend with more features. User is able to select the time slot and date to block.|More difficult to implement. More testing required. Blocked time slots will have to be added one by one.|

We originally intended for the user to block out a certain time slot for every day, making Option 1 a possibility, but we eventually decided that Option 2 will still be able to achieve this (although a little more effort is required) and is much more flexible.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSchedule`. It extends `Schedule` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `scheduleStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSchedule#commit()` — Saves the current schedule state in its history.
* `VersionedSchedule#undo()` — Restores the previous schedule state from its history.
* `VersionedSchedule#redo()` — Restores a previously undone schedule state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSchedule()`, `Model#undoSchedule()` and `Model#redoSchedule()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSchedule` will be initialized with the initial schedule state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single schedule state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the schedule. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSchedule()`, causing the modified state of the schedule after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `scheduleStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted schedule state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new event. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSchedule()`, causing another modified schedule state to be saved into the `scheduleStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSchedule()`, so the schedule state will not be saved into the `scheduleStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the event was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSchedule()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous schedule state, and restores the schedule to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Schedule state, then there are no previous Schedule states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSchedule()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoSchedule()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the schedule to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `scheduleStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest schedule state, then there are no undone Schedule states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSchedule()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the schedule, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSchedule()`, `Model#undoSchedule()` or `Model#redoSchedule()`. Thus, the `scheduleStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSchedule()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `scheduleStateList`, all schedule states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire schedule.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the event being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

   1. Prerequisites: List all events using the `list` command. Multiple events in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First event is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted event shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No event is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
