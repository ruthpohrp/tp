## **Introduction**
***
DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists **university professors** in managing
their **consultations**, through the usage of an intuitive **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**<sup>1</sup>
and an easy-to-navigate **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**<sup>2</sup>.

It is named `DukePro(f)` (Duke-Professor) because our project's target audience is professors, and it is also a nod
to our CS2103T iP (individual Project), which was named `Duke`.

Amidst long hours of lectures and tutorials in the week, professors may still need to cater timeslots for student
consultations, which can be hard to come by and difficult to keep track of. This is where Dukepro(f)
comes in to help you out!

With DukePro(f), you will be able to:

* Add, edit, and delete your consultations
* List all of your consultations, or just your next consultation
* List your free time slots for consultation booking
* Block certain time slots to ensure your consultations don't clash with other commitments
* And many other small quality of life features!

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="260" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of DukePro(f).

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

| Component | Description | API | Concrete Implementation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**`Main`**|Consists of two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them with each other upon app launch. Upon shut down, it is also responsible for shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.|-|-|

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />


The `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (in order to prevent outside components' from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

`Logic` is split into 2 packages, `Command` and `Parser`. This is how `Logic` works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ScheduleParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions discussed above for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the earlier class diagram) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
1. When called upon to parse a user command, the `ScheduleParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ScheduleParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
2. All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)
<p align="center">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the schedule data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `SortEventList` object) and all `BlockedSlot` objects (which are contained in a `SortedBlockedSlotList`).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Schedule`, which `Event` references. This allows `Schedule` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can _save_ both **schedule data** and **user preference data** in json format, and _read_ them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ScheduleStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### SortedEventList

#### Description
The `SortedEventList` class provides an abstraction over an internal list of `Events`.
The `SortedEventList` supports minimal list operations including add, remove and set.
Duplicate Events are allowed in this Event list to accommodate repeated consultations with the same person.

#### Implementation
The `SortedEventList` class contains 2 fields, `internalList` and `internalUnmodifiableList`.

The `internalList` is an `ObservableArrayList` that is not sorted.

The `internalUnmodifiableList` is a `SortedList` that wraps around the `internalList` to maintain the sorted property of Events.
All changes in the `internalList` are propagated immediately to the SortedList.
An `EventComparator` class that implements the `Comparator` interface is created and used when constructing `SortedList`.

The `SortedEventList#asUnmodifiableObservableList()` method returns an ObservableList that the Ui can listen to display the list of consultations on the right.
This ObservableList will have its Events sorted chronologically.
This ObservableList is unmodifiable as part of defensive programming to prevent other classes from adding or deleting events from the ObservableList.

### Block Feature
#### Description

The Block feature allows the user to block off a specified period of time so that it is not possible for a new `Event` to be created during that time slot.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation

##### Model
The following class diagram illustrates the implementation of the Block feature.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/BlockedSlotClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</p>

As shown in the class diagram, both `Event` and `BlockedSlot` implement the `Overlappable` interface. They also have their respective implementations of the `SortedOverlappableList` interface, `SortedEventList` and `SortedBlockedSlotList` respectively.
Every `Overlappable` is able to check if it overlaps with another `Overlappable`. This allows us to maintain a `SortedEventList` and a `SortedBlockedSlotList` in a `Schedule` and check against both lists when adding/editing an `Overlappable`.

##### Logic
The Block feature comes with the following new commands, they are quite self-explanatory:
1. `AddBlockedSlotCommand`
2. `ListBlockedSlotsCommand`
3. `DeleteBlockedSlotCommand`

Existing commands `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` also had to be edited (see below) to check for overlaps 
before adding/editing the `Event`.

The following steps describe the execution of an `AddCommand`(`EditCommand`follows similarly):
1. The `execute()` method of the `AddCommand` checks if the `Event` to be added overlaps with any items in the `Schedule`'s `SortedEventList` or `SortedBlockedSlotList`.
    1. If there is an overlap, a `SlotBlockedException`(which extends `CommandException`) is thrown, with an error message telling the user if the command was blocked by another event or a blocked slot.
    2. If there is no overlap, the new `Event` is added and the command succeeds.

##### Storage
These changes also needed a new `JsonAdaptedBlockedSlot` in order to save blocked slots
created by the user into save file.
`JsonSerializableSchedule` has a new field `blockedSlots`, which is a list of `JsonAdaptedBlockedSlot`s.
When `JsonScheduleStorage` reads the json file where the data is stored, it constructs a
`JsonSerializableSchedule` based on the `events` and `blockedSlots` fields found in the json file, and
then converts it to a `Schedule` object for DukePro(f) to access.
A new field `blockedSlots`, a `SortedBlockedSlotList`, is added to `Schedule` such that when it makes a copy of
itself and then performs `Schedule#resetData()`, the blockedSlots data is not erased.

#### Design Considerations:

|   |Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Alternative 1: Have the `TimeSlot` class maintain a list of blocked time slots and prevent any new overlapping `TimeSlots` from being created.|Easy to implement. User is able to block out a specific time slot every day(e.g., 1800-1900 for dinner every day).|Does not work well with `FreeSlots` feature. User is unable to choose which days to have the blocked slot as it is applied to every day.|
|Alternative 2 (currently chosen): Implementation described above.|Code is easier to extend with more features. User is able to select the time slot and date to block.|More difficult to implement. More testing required. Blocked time slots will have to be added one by one.|

We originally intended for the user to block out a certain time slot for every day, making Alternative 1 a possibility, but we eventually decided that Alternative 2 will still be able to achieve this (although a little more effort is required) and is much more flexible.

### List Free Slots Feature

#### Description
The List Free Slots Feature allows users to list down all free slots in the schedule from now
to 2359 of the day with the last event/blocked slot.

#### Implementation
This feature introduces a new command called `ListFreeSlotsCommand`.

The `ListFreeSlotsCommand` class has two fields `today` of type `Date` and `now` of type `LocalTime`. These fields are necessary to allow testing, where a specific date and time can be passed in to the `ListFreeSlotsCommand`.
The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between various components when a `ListFreeSlotsCommand` is executed.

<p align ="center">
    <img src="images/ListFreeSlotsCommand.png"/>
</p>

The `execute()` method calls `model#getFreeSlots()` which calls `schedule#getFreeSlots()`. This command does not update the model.
Instead a list of FreeSlot is returned. The `execute()` method then wraps this list of FreeSlot in a `CommandResult` to be displayed to user.

The activity diagram below shows the process that occurs in `schedule#getFreeSlots()` to generate the list of free slots.

<p align ="center">
    <img src="images/getFreeSlotsActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>
</p>

The `schedule#getFreeSlots()` method first combines the `SortedEventList` and the `SortedBlockedSlotList` into one list of Overlappables.

The `schedule#getFreeSlots()` method then iterates through this list of Overlappables to find free slots between events/blocked slots.

Finally, the `schedule#getFreeSlots()` method removes past freeSlot and returns a list of future freeSlots.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations:

|   |Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
| Alternative 1: Implement FreeSlots as a special Event and store FreeSlots in the SortedEventList|Easy to list all free slots in the schedule by using a predicate to select only FreeSlots and updating the filteredList.|Adding, deleting and editing event will be harder as the corresponding FreeSlot at that timeslot will need to be deleted or edited. Only one list containing all Events, FreeSlots and BlockedSlots is allowed.|
| Alternative 2 (current): Go through the schedule each time the user uses the `list_free` command to find free slots|Easy to add, delete and edit events in SortedEventList. Easy to add additional lists such as SortedBlockedSlotList.|More computationally intensive as each time the user uses the `list_free` command, DukePro(f) will iterate through all events and blocked slots to find free slots in between.|

Alternative 2 is chosen to allow future implementations such as adding additional lists 
containing different types of events or commitments. 


### Today's Upcoming Events Feature
#### Description
The Upcoming Events feature lists all the upcoming events scheduled for the current day excluding
the ongoing consultation event.

#### Implementation
The `UpcomingEventsCommand` class has one field timePredicate of type EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate.

`EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's timeslot and date is after the current time and date.

The `UpcomingEventsCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered list of the upcoming events, filtered by the `timePredicate`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions discussed above for the execute("upcoming_events") API call:

<p align ="center">
    <img src="images/UpcomingEventsSequenceDiagram.png"/>
</p>

### Next Event Feature
#### Description
The Next Event feature displays the next event based on the current time in the schedule.

#### Implementation
The `NextEventCommand` class has one field timePredicate of type EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate.

`EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's timeslot and date is after the current time and date.

The `NextEventCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered upcoming event that is filtered by the `timePredicate`.
Next, it gets the first event in the filtered list using the overridden method `nextEventInTheList()` found in the `ModelManager` class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the NextEventCommand:

<p align ="center">
    <img src= "images/NextEventActivityDiagram.png">
</p>

### Filter by Tag Feature
#### Description
The Filter by Tag feature allows users to find all the consultation events whose tags contain any of the specified keywords (case-insensitive) and displays them as an indexed list.

#### Implementation
The `FilterByTagCommand` class has one field tagPredicate of type TagContainsKeywordsPredicate.

`TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`, found under `model/event` package, is  a class that checks whether an event's tag(s) matches any of the keyword(s) given.

The `FilterByTagCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered list of the events that have the specified tag. It is filtered by the `tagPredicate`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions discussed above for the execute("filter_tag URGENT") API call:
<p align ="center">
    <img src= "images/FilterByTagSequenceDiagram.png"/>
</p>


### Remark feature
#### Description

The Remark feature is an optional description added to `Event`. It adds a remark to the
consultation event, and is stored internally as a `Remark` in `seedu.address.model.event.Event`.

#### Implementation

The `Remark` class has one field `value` of type String.

Unlike the other Objects in `Event`, all `Remark` inputs are valid, and hence do not need to check for Validity, unless the input is `null`.

There are two ways the remark can be added to an `Event`:
* `AddCommand(Event)` method  — Adds a new `Event` to the list (now with an optional remark description attached to it).
* `EditCommand(Event)` method — Edits the remark description of an existing `Event` on the list.

As a Remark is an optional input, if user does not input any remarks when adding a new event, the Remark will simply be stored as an empty String `””` in `Remark` in `Event` as default.

To display the remark in the GUI, a new `Label` called `remark` is added to `EventCard` as well as `EventListCard.fxml`.

### CommandSummary Command
#### Description

The `CommandSummaryCommand` class is a command that opens a pop-up window containing a Command Summary of DukePro(f)'s
possible commands.

#### Implementation

This implementation of this command adds another parameter `showCommands` (which has a default value of `false`) to the 
constructor of `CommandResult`.

When the command `command_summary` is input by the user, `LogicManager` parses the input and returns a 
`CommandSummaryCommand`. The `execute` method is called with the `showCommands` parameter being set to `true`. 
This causes `MainWindow` to execute the `handleCommandSummary` method, which opens the Command Summary Page.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic class mentioned above for the 
execute("command_summary") API call:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder.

   1. Double-click the jar file. 
    Expected:
<br>
<img src="images/startup.png" width="600px">
<br>
Shows the GUI with a set of sample events. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.
      

### Deleting an event

1. Deleting an event while all events are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all events using the `list` command. Multiple events in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First event is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted event shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No event is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list 
   size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
   

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted/invalid `schedule.json` file in `data` directory
